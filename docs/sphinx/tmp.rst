There will be a consultation period before each major release. 
Major releases may include breaking changes.



The OME consortium currently provides three major tools capable of working
with OME-XML and OME-TIFF:

-  The :bf_plone:`Bio-Formats <>` library is a full-featured library with many
   features related to OME-XML, including conversion of third party file
   format metadata into OME-XML structures. It can write image data to the
   OME-TIFF format.

-  :cpp_plone:`OME Files C++ <>` is a reference implementation of the OME
   data model and OME-TIFF for C++ developers wishing to support these in 
   their own software. It can read and write OME-TIFF data.

-  The :omero_plone:`OMERO server <>` works directly with OME-XML. It can
   import data from OME-XML and OME-TIFF, as well as export to OME-TIFF.


If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work please
use the :about_plone:`correct citations <licensing-attribution/citing-ome>` to
acknowledge us.

We have received support from several companies who use our file formats, for
details see our list of :about_plone:`Partners <partners>`.
